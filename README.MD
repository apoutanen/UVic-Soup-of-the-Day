Hello! This is the base code I am writing for a twitter bot that uses BeautifulSoup to scrape the UVic Soup of the Day website and tweet out the contents. 

This is still a project in progress, there are a few more things to add before it is up and ready to go:
-Add logic to make sure that the website has been updated before a tweet is sent
-Add logic to break strings into chunks if the string is longer than 280 characters (tweet limit)
